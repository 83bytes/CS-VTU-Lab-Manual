\chapter{Zombie process}

Write a C/C++ program that creates a zombie and then calls system to execute the ps command to verify that the process is zombie.

\subsection{Theory}

In unix terminology, a process that has terminated, but whose parent has not yet waited for it, is called a zombie.

fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, referred to as the child, is an exact duplicate of the calling process, referred to as the parent. Sleep() : Delay for a specified amount of time.

system() executes a command specified in command by calling "/bin/sh -c", and returns after the command has been completed.

\subsection{Code}

\lstinputlisting[style=source-file]{07CreateZombie/create_zombie.c}

\subsection{Output}

The output will look something like this.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=shell-output]
  PID  PPID S TT       COMMAND
  315   309 S pts/0    /usr/bin/fish -i
31732   315 S pts/0    ./usp07.out
31733 31732 Z pts/0    [usp07.out] <defunct>
31734 31732 R pts/0    ps -o pid,ppid,state,tty,command
\end{lstlisting}
